        <h1>Everything you need to know before travelling to Sri Lanka</h1>
        Such a small nation, Sri Lanka is hugely diverse. Sand-sprinkled beaches rise to forested national parks, temple-studded plains, and jungle-covered highlands, with the added perk that nowhere is that far from the beach. Most visitors start on the coast and duck inland to tea gardens, ancient cities and national parks, but navigating Sri Lanka's frenetic public transport system and cultural sensitivities can be confusing for new arrivals. To help you out, here are some of the things you need to know before traveling to Sri Lanka. 
        <h3>Check the health rules</h3>
        Lanka imposed strict public health measures during the Covid pandemic, so check the latest health rules before you travel. Sri Lanka is a tropical destination, so check with your doctor to make sure you're up to date with your travel vaccinations. 
        <h3>Plan your trip according to the monsoons</h3>
        Different parts of Sri Lanka during their rainy ‘off-seasons’ has its rewards – visitor numbers fall and hotel rates drop quite significantly.</dd>
        <h3>Understanding money in Sri Lanka</h3>
        Stock up on rupees on arrival in Sri Lanka, not before, and don't change more than you need. Sri Lankan rupees are hard to exchange outside of Sri Lanka. ATMs are widespread all over the country - stick to Bank of Ceylon ATMs where possible as they don't charge a fee. 
        <h3>Pack the right gear for Sri Lanka’s hills and religious sites</h3>
        Sri Lanka’s mountains reach elevations of over 2000m (6560ft) and temperatures are lower in the highlands than on the coast. Pack a light jumper for cooler nights and early morning starts (particularly between December and March). Also bring a sarong – you can use it as a beach blanket or towel, as a shawl or skirt to cover your shoulders or knees when visiting temples, and as a warm layer when traveling on air-conditioned buses or for pre-dawn safari jeep drives.
        <h3>Dress appropriately, with respect for Sri Lankan traditions, Dress respectfully when visiting temples</h3>
        Despite the island's well-developed tourist industry, many Sri Lankans are socially conservative and deeply religious. Swimwear is fine for the beach, but not when wandering about town. Going nude or topless is not permitted on any Sri Lankan beaches. Avoid clothing that shows the legs or upper arms and shoulders when making trips to religious sites.  Public displays of affection are also frowned on, as is loud or brash behavior, and losing your temper in public
        <h3>Stay safe from crime in Sri Lanka</h3>
        Sri Lanka is one of the safest countries in Asia when it comes to petty crime. Violence against tourists is very rare, and theft and robberies are uncommon, though they do happen occasionally.  As a precaution, wear a money belt and use your hotel safe.
        <h3>Be aware of the risks of natural disasters</h3>
        The most common natural disaster in Sri Lanka is localized flooding during the southwest and northeast monsoons, which can cause landslides in highland areas. Sri Lanka is also vulnerable to tropical cyclones and periods of drought.
