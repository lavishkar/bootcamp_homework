    <h1>Why should you vistit Srilanka</h1>
    <p>The short answer is because it’s awesome, offering everything from great surf to amazing animal encounters to magnificent beaches to spectacular culture and food, all in an easy to explore size.
       In case you need a bit more convincing though, here are some more facts. Sri Lanka is an independent island nation located off the coast of India in the beautiful Indian Ocean. In 2009, the 26—year long war finally came to an end, with a heavy focus on tourism developing in the intervening years. 
       Sri Lanka could be described as a “lite” version of India. Having never been to India, I can’t exactly comment. However, if India has always fascinated you, but has perhaps felt too overwhelming to tackle, then Sri Lanka could serve as the perfect starting point. Although, having visited, you will probably just want to come back.
       Sri Lanka has a wonderful, friendly people, delicious food (particularly if you like curry!), beaches, rainforests, natural attractions and mountains, as well as a multitude of cultural and historical attractions.
       There’s no shortage of activities to suit everyone, from adventure seekers to nature lovers, to people just wanting to relax and unwind on a gorgeous beach.</p>
    <h1>Which is the best time to visit</h1>
    <p>This isn’t as easy a question to answer as you might think, because despite being so small, Sri Lanka has markedly different climates across the island, due to it having two separate monsoon seasons.
        The good news is that there’s always going to be somewhere sunny on the island. The bad news… somewhere else is likely to be wet!        
        Rain in sri lanka, Generally, April – June is the wettest season in the west and hill country (including Kandy).        
        The east coast, on the other hand, has its wet season in November / December.          
        For the itinerary I’ve outlined below, which covers the west and south coasts as well as hill country, the best time to visit is going to be December through to the end of March. Just be aware that prices will be higher during this time period. See more on budget towards the end of the post.
        Temperature wise, there isn’t much variance through the year as Sri Lanka is quite close to the equator. Expect daily temperatures of around 28 degrees C ( 82F) in the lower and coastal areas, decreasing as you go up in height to average around 20 degrees C (68F) in Kandy. Humidity is high everywhere, ranging from 60 – 90%.
