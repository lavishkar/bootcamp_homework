<h3>Day 1: Colombo, City Exploration</h3>

<p>To be honest, Colombo isn’t really worth spending a lot of time in, compared to the rest of the country. However, since all the international flights arrive here, it makes a good stop to recover from a long journey, adjust to the time zone and start getting used to the heat. I’d suggest checking into a hotel here and relaxing for your arrival day, with a bit of sight-seeing thrown in if you’re up to it.
Highlights of Colombo include the National Museum, the Old City Hall and Viharamahdevi Park, plus you can take walking tours and naturally there are plenty of restaurants, bars and cafes.<br>
<h3>Days 2 – 4: Habarana, Elephants and UNESCO sights</h3>

Once you’re acclimatised and relaxed, it’s time to head into the country, head north to what is known as Sri Lanka’s cultural triangle, around four or five hours drive from Colombo.Base yourself near or in the town of Habarana, in the Anuradhapura district, and take some time to see the following sights.
Sigiriya an absolute must-visit when coming to Sri Lanka, this giant rock rises above the surrounding plains to a height of 200m, and served as the palatial fortress and home of one of Sri Lanka’s early Kings in the 5th century AD.
Polonnaruwa is the second oldest of Sri Lanka’s original kingdoms, having been here since at least 1070AD. Today it is one of the best preserved archaeological destinations in the country, and well worth your time to visit. It’s quite spread out, so you are likely going to need to hire some form of transport to get around the whole place. Bikes are a good option.
Minneriya National Park If all that culture is a bit much, fear not, this region has another magnificent attraction, in the form of the Sri Lankan wild elephant. These guys are a subspecies of the Asian elephant, so a little smaller than their African cousins.
Despite being on the endangered list, Sri Lanka has the highest density of wild elephants in Asia, so you are almost guaranteed to see elephants. The best way to do so is by taking an elephant safari into one of the national parks, with Minneriya National Park being one excellent spot to do so, although this will vary depending on the time of year. We saw literally hundreds of elephants from the back of our jeep, a truly incredible experience.
The Golden Temple of Danbulla Last on this list, since this is the cultural triangle, you should also make time to visit the third UNESCO site in this area, the Golden Temple of Danbulla. This is Sri Lanka’s best-preserved cave temple complex, and has been a site of pilgrimage for over two thousand years. <br>
<h3>Days 5 – 6: Kandy, Hill Country</h3>

It’s around a 2 hour drive, or 4hr bus ride. The Habarana region down to Kandy, the largest town in hill country, where the climate is cooler and, likely, wetter. Here, highlights include:
The Temple of the Tooth – one of Sri Lanka’s holiest shrines, the Temple of the Tooth houses a relic of the Buddha. It’s an important site of pilgrimage, and is well worth visiting, even if seeing the actual tooth is a bit tricky. Note that security is quite tight, with security scanners and guards, and you will have to be appropriately dressed to enter. If you love temples, Kandy has plenty more to choose from, so you can spend a good deal of time exploring!
Tea! Sri Lanka, once known as Ceylon, is world famous for its tea, and the hills around Kandy are full of the stuff. A good place to get a handle on it all is at the Tea Musuem. This four storey building is a short (3km) trip from Kandy, and offers four floors of tea facts, as well as a lovely view of the surrounding landscape.
The Royal Botanical Garden – probably the best garden in Sri Lanka, these gardens feature a giant banyan tree, an orchid house and bats. Entry is just shy of 10USD.
Finally, if you’re feeling like a good hike, Kandy is a great launching point for one of Sri Lanka’s most popular hikes, up Adam’s Peak. This is an important pilgrimage for multiple religions, as there is a footprint on the top believed to belong to Shiva, Adam or the Buddha, depending on which religion you ask.
The mountain is just over 2 km high, and the hike will take you a total time of 4 – 7 hours, depending on fitness. Most visitors climb to see either sunrise or sunset.  <br>
<h3>Days 7 – 10: Galle, Beaches and Forts </h3>

After all that culture, maybe it’s time to relax a bit, and head to the south. Leaving Kandy, I can highly recommend taking the scenic train towards Colombo, which offers stunning views of the scenery. Then, you can take either the bus or train on to the fortified city of Galle, your next destination.
Built by the Dutch, the original city of Galle dates from 1663, and is today one of the best surviving examples of a fortified port city in Asia. It’s also a UNESCO world heritage site.
These days, it’s a wonderful, vibrant place to wander about, with highlights including those incredible walls and the lighthouse. It’s also filled with boutiques, cafes and hotels.
Around Galle, there is also plenty to see and do, with visits to the beach towns of Unawatuna and Hikkaduwa recommended, both of which offer stunning beaches, dotted with cafe’s and bars, on which you can get your relaxation properly on.<br>
<h3>Days 11 – 13: The Far South – Whales, Leopards and More Beaches</h3>
<img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c8e900_9bab7c5dddc548cabc8a919fda482a4b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1470,h_567,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/2.jpg" width="800" height="400"> <br>
If you can tear yourself away from Galle and surrounds, then I can recommend heading even further along the south coast. The further you go, the more deserted and gorgeous the beaches become. When I visited, these beach towns were everything I had ever hoped for from previous trips to Asia, but never quite found. You should definitely visit before everyone else figures this out, to wander beaches lit by candle-light against a back drop of surf.
If you do go into the south, a couple of things you should definitely do:<br>
Visit Yala National Park – before I visited Sri Lanka I had no idea how incredible the wildlife viewing opportunities were. Yala National Park is full of wildlife, but the main attraction is without doubt the leopard. Yala has one of the highest densities of Leopard anywhere in the world, meaning your chance to see these animals is pretty good.
Go Whale Watching – the seas off the southern coast of Sri Lanka are filled with all sorts of marine life, but the big draw are the whales. 
They also work with local scientific organisations, collecting data on the whales, and at one point during the trip the captain even hailed a passing tanker and gave them a verbal dressing down for their illegal waste dumping.
<br>
And that’s the end of this two week Sri Lanka trip itinerary!
